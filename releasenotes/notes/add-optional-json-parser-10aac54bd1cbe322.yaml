    This change adds support for an optional trace JSON decoder that will attempt to parse a
    trace, even if the trace is partially misconformed, such as one having port numbers within
    the meta field, which would previously throw an error. Additionally, the change also adds 
    a default parser of json.loads, which was originally used. The new parser can be used by
    specifying the `DD_SUPPRESS_TRACE_PARSE_ERRORS` env variable or by setting the flag `--suppress-trace-parse-errors`.
