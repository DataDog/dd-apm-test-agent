    Updates the logic for associating requests with a session.  Prior to this change:
    (1) non-existent tokens were permitted and returned associations with all requests, 
    (2) existent tokens returned associations with all matching requests + all untokenized requests after the session was created

    After this change:
    (1) Requests with non-existent tokens return 400 error codes
    (2) Requests with existent tokens return all matching requests + all untokenized requests after the session was created but 
    only up to the next session creation.

    Requests without a token continue to return all requests.
