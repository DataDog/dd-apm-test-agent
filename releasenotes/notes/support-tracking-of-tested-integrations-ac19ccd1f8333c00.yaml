    Add support for tracking the integrations being tested. Tracked integrations can be recorded by a [PUT] request to the Test Agent
    at `/test/session/integrations`. To get data about which integrations the Test Agent encountered, make a [GET] request to `/test/integrations/tested_versions`.
    Tested integrations include information such as the integration name, the tested integration version, the tracer language, the tracer version and the 
    dependency name of the integration.
