    OTLP: Added OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) metrics support via HTTP endpoint ``/v1/metrics`` on port 4318 and GRPC server on port 4317.
    Supports all OTLP metric types including Gauge, Sum, Histogram, ExponentialHistogram, and Summary.
    The GRPC server forwards requests to the OTLP HTTP server for validation and storage, enabling testing of applications that send metrics via either protocol.
    Session endpoint ``/test/session/metrics`` allows retrieval of captured metrics for test validation.
